\section{Accelerating the energy transition through innovation: Chapter 1}
\subsection{New global developments that affect the energy sector}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Paris Agreement
	\begin{itemize}
		\item objective: keep the global avg temperature rise "well
		below $2 \degree$ and try to limit this to $1.5 \degree$.
	\end{itemize}
	\item United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal number 7
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ensure universal access to modern energy by 2030
		\item double the rate of energy efficiency improvement by 2030
		\item significantly accelerate deployment of renewable
		energy
	\end{itemize}
	\item in 2015, the share of renewables in primary energy supply was
	about 16\% and the share of renewables in electricity generation was
	24\%
	\item over the last 5 years, the cost of solar PV has fallen by 80\%
	and the cost of wind by 30\%
	\item taller wind turbines can reach better quality wind resources
	\item EVs use a third of the energy and accelerate faster than
	conventional cars
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is energy transition?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IFET states the central role of accelerated deployment of
	energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is innovation?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item technology breakthroughs that provide renewable solutions to
	sectors where at present no cost-effective alternatives to
	conventional energy technologies exist
	\item improvements to the existing renewable technologies, which
	reduce cost and stimuate deployment
	\item new business models and engagement of new actors across
	energy systems, allowing for a profitable scale-up of renewable
	technologies
	\item new types of financing that reduce cost and enhance access to
	funds
	\item enabling policy and regulatory innovations that provide
	incentives for market access and growth
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Status of the energy transition}
Energy sector innovation cycle:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item technology push
	\item research
	\item development
	\item demonstration
	\item market development
	\item commercial diffusion
	\item market pull
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item limiting climate change to below $2 \degree$ implies a reduction
	of energy related CO$_2$ emissions of nearly 70\% rom 2015 levels
	\item globally more than 32 Gt of energy-related CO$_2$ were emitted in
	2015
	\item these emissions need to fall to 9.5 Gt by 2050 to limit warming
	to $2 \degree$
	\item energy efficiency measures and renewable energy will according
	to REmap and IRENA deliver about 90\% of the emissions reductions
	needed to decarbonise the global energy system
	\item the world is underinvesting in innovation
\end{itemize}
