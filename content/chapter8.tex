\section{Chapter 8: Low-carbon mobility}

\subsection{Transportation in 2020 is powered mostly by petroleum}

\begin{itemize}
	\item petroleum is easy to store and transport
	\item fuels from petroleum have very high energy density
	\item they include diesel, petrol (gasoline in US), kerosene, jet fuel,
	liqueified petroleum gas
\end{itemize}

The future of mobility will be driven by new technologies that will facilitate
\begin{enumerate}
	\item automation of driving and transport systems through advances in
	artificial intelligence;
	\item electrification of automobility, which will make the translation
	of energy into wheel motion more efficient;
	\item decarbonization of transport by using more people-powered
	transport (walking and biking) and less carbon-intensive fuels, such
	as solar-powered electricity for EVs, hydrogen generated from clean
	energy, and biofuels.
\end{enumerate}

Why US consumes excessive amounts of oil products:
\begin{itemize}
	\item inefficient fuel fleet
	\item absence of more efficient diesel cars
	\item complete absence of high-velocity trains
\end{itemize}

Paths to decarbonizing transport focus on:

\begin{itemize}
	\item driving less, more biking, avoided travel, walking
	\item replace combustion engines with electric vehicles
	\item decarbonize energy sources that power vehicles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electric vehicles}
\begin{itemize}
	\item more than 90\% of criteria air pollutants are created from
	combustion
	\item the full life-cycle economic cost of a vehicle is its cost plus
	the cost of fueling it over some determined time
	\item li-ion batteries are used in all sorts of electronics so EVs
	benefit from the attention of all industries
	\item these batteries do not contain a lot of lithium as a percentage
	of the total battery
	\item Tesla, Nissan and GM use lithium manganese oxide batteries
	\item Toyota uses lithium nickel cobalt oxide
	\item BYD uses lithium iron phosphate
\end{itemize}

Challenges for EVs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item charging stations -- finding places for them in the cities or
	homes with driveways
	\item range anxiety
\end{itemize}
